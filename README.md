## Estimote Beacons 
Estimote Beacons are small wireless sensors that we can attach to any location or object. They broadcast tiny radio signals which our smartphone can receive and interpret, unlocking micro-location and contextual awareness.

We have assumed that an Estimote beacon is attached at some Airtel Store. The data related to that airtel store, along with estimote id, are uploaded on the cloud.

##Features

###1. Notify the user
As soon as the app comes in proximity (upto 70m) to the store it receives a push notification welcoming the user to the store.

For every new user, we update his information (Mobile Number and his Service provider) to the server. For every 1000th user, we have a special prize (some coupons) for the user.

###2. Display Services
As soon as the estimote is detected by the app, the services offered by that store are downloaded from the cloud and presented to the user. The services which require personel assistance would generate a token number and would tell user, the estimated time left. The main benefit of this is, that the user need not wait in the queue. He just needs to show his token number.
