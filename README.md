## Estimote Beacons 
Estimote Beacons are small wireless sensors that we can attach to any location or object. They broadcast tiny radio signals which our smartphone can receive and interpret, unlocking micro-location and contextual awareness.

##Features

###1. Notify the user
We have assumed that an Estimote beacon is attached at some Airtel Store. As soon as the app comes in proximity (upto 50m) to the store it receives a push notification welcoming the user to the store. For every 1000th user, we have a special prize (some coupons) for the user.

###2. Display Services
As soon as the estimote is detected by the app, the services offered by that store are downloaded from the cloud and presented to the user. When a user selects some service, he is provided with some unique token number, and an estimated waiting time. The main benefit of this is, that the user need not to wait in the queue. He just needs to show his token number.

###3. Display Stores
If the user needs to visit an Airtel Store, the app provides him with the information related to the nearby Airtel stores.
